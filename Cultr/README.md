# cultr website

This is a Node/Express website. To start it, you must have [Node.JS][]
installed.

## First time

Install all of the dependencies with this:

    npm install

## Every time you want to start the server in development mode:

    npm start

But all that really does is...

    node index.js

# Recommended

For doing Node.JS development, use node-dev:

    npm install -g node-dev


[Node.JS]: http://nodejs.org/
http://localhost:3000/

#HOW TO LOG ON TO SERVER:
sshfs cult:/home/cpb DAWEB
